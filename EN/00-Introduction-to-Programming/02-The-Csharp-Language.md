# Programming Languages, Compilers, Interpreters
The **programming language** defines a set of rules (syntax)

Languages are either **compiled** (like C#, C++) or **interpreted** (like JavaScript and Python)

The **compiler** translates programming code to **machine code**

* During the compilation, it finds syntax errors

The **interpreter** executes the code line by line

* It finds syntax errors at runtime

# The C# Language
**C#** is modern, general purpose programming language

* Used for creating web apps, mobile apps, games, back-end apps

**Object-oriented**

* C# programs consists of **classes**, which hold **methods**

Good choice for beginners

* Easy syntax, easy to read, **easy to learn**
* Big developer **community**, many jobs
* Lots of **resources**: books, lessons, courses

# C# Compilation and Execution
C# is a **high-level language**, which is **compiled**

A program in C# is written in text format (**source code**)

The result of execution is called an executable file (**prog.exe**)

C# uses a handful of tools, provided by the **.NET Core**

* Compilers, runtime environment, virtual machine
